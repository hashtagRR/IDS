## Machine Learning Intrusion Detection System

## Overview

This project implements a machine learning-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that leverages both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. The system is designed to detect network intrusions and zero-day attacks, enhancing the security of computer networks.

## Features

- **Supervised Learning for Intrusion Detection**: Utilizes labeled data to train a machine learning model for the detection of known intrusion patterns.
- **Unsupervised Learning for Zero-Day Attack Detection**: Employing unsupervised learning algorithms to identify novel and previously unseen attack patterns.
- **Scalability**: Designed to be scalable for large-scale networks and adapt to evolving threats.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides an easy-to-use interface for network administrators to monitor and manage security alerts.
